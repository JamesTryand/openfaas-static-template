# openfaas-static-template

This is a skeleton function for hosting static content. Make a folder called ```public``` and put the content you want to host in there. I've used the name 'public' since that's a common output folder in node and js/ts projects for static content, so this should play nicely out of the box with things such as react, angular, vue or whatever other frontend jamstack tooling you wish to use.
